ATEF - Automated Test Execution Framework
=========================================

Disclaimer
^^^^^^^^^^

ATEF is still in beta; features are still in development and bugs may have slipped
through.  If you have any feedback, we would very much appreciate you leaving an
issue in our `github repository <https://github.com/pcdshub/atef>`_.

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

Atef is an initialism that stands for "Automated Test Execution Framework."
Atef is meant to be a framework tailored for automating checkout and diagnostic
procedures using the control system. It will provide functionality for
automating checkout procedures, and the collection of the results of those
checkout procedures. The concept is to provide a way for everyone to build
checkout procedures that can be run in the control system easily, and
consistently. It is meant to address the dynamic nature of the entire system
(the LCLS machine), by providing a way to establish and routinely verify a
performance baseline. The project seeks to combine the best practices and
features of software testing automation, and our favorite control system
automation packages together to form a powerful tool for maintaining our
systems.
